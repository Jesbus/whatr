{"name":"Whatr","tagline":"The Whatr web browser project.","body":"# Whatr web browser\r\n## What is it?\r\nThe Whatr web browser project is a project to create a web browser named Whatr.\r\n## Why is it?\r\nWhen I launch Firefox on my PC it instantly gobbles up 200+ MB ram. The same goes for Chrome.\r\nAnd when I launch Internet Explorer, it crashes.\r\nBut mainly this project is just for my personal entertainment :)\r\n## When is it?\r\nIt's a one man project, so it will not be fast. I don't have any timeframes, because I don't need any. It's a hobby project...\r\n## Where is it?\r\nIt's on Github, obviously. But there is also an annoying website: http://whatr.org\r\n## Who is it?\r\nThe human condition does not apply to any computer programs, as far as I know.\r\n## How is it?\r\nThe programming language used is C++","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
